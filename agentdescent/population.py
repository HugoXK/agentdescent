"""Population search on a single-head ledger: how a `SelectionPolicy` runs today.

:mod:`agentdescent.selection` defines *where the next batch starts*; this module
is what makes the answer take effect before the ledger can hold several live
heads. The trick is the one GEPA and DGM each found on their own: keep the
candidate pool **in the aggregator**, and make "selection" a ledger commit that
rewrites the head. The heads are serialised rather than concurrent, so one
`dev` branch is enough.

:class:`PopulationAggregator` subclasses the shipped
:class:`~agentdescent.aggregator.Aggregator` -- staleness, conflict, fusion,
statistical acceptance and promotion all run unchanged -- and adds three things
around it: it archives every distinct committed head with its held-out score,
asks the selection policy which archived candidate the next batch should mutate,
and commits that candidate back to ``dev``. ``finalize`` commits the archive's
best scorer, so a run's final artifact is its best candidate rather than
whichever one it was exploring when the budget ran out.

## Why this lives in the engine

It was written in ``examples/_population.py`` and installed by the port runner,
which meant one `Policies(selection=...)` bundle had three meanings: `evolve()`
refused it, `async_evolve()` dropped it (fixed separately), and the port runner
honoured it through `aggregator_factory=`. A field that means three things is
worse than a field that means nothing, and only one of the three was the
behaviour the docs described.

## The boundary that used to be here

The parent switch is a **state replacement**, and it used to be written as
``head.apply(Diff(ops=target_state))``. That only *sets* keys, so a key the head
had and the target does not survived the switch: on a grow-only key space
(``AppendRules``) the "switch" was a union, and the run silently hill-climbed
instead of exploring. It was invisible in the ports because every declared
policy rode a fixed-key artifact. Moving the layer into the engine makes the
pairing reachable by any caller, so the switch now carries explicit ``None``
deletions for the keys the target does not have -- the sentinel
:meth:`~agentdescent.evolution.EvolvingArtifact.apply` already understood, and
the one :meth:`~agentdescent.evolution.EvolvingArtifact.diff` already emits.

    bonus by this, so a cheap candidate gets more speculative looks than an
    expensive one at the same rank. It is a *proxy* and the policy treats a
