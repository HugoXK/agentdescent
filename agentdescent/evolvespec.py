"""An ``evolve()`` call as data, so a caller that is not Python can make one.

``workspec.RolloutSpec`` describes *one rollout* completely enough to run it in
another process. This module does the same for a *whole run*: which artifact,
against which data, scored how, executed by which agent, under which policies.
An :class:`EvolveSpec` is JSON; a host agent (Claude Code, DeepSeek Harness,
Codex) writes one from a user's request, the CLI and the MCP server read it, and
:func:`compose` turns it into exactly the ``evolve()`` call the quickstarts show.

Two things it deliberately is not.

**It is not a second Python entry point.** The one-call wrappers
(``evolve_skill_dir`` and friends) were removed because each was another
signature to keep in step with ``evolve()``. Python callers should keep writing
the ``evolve()`` call; this module exists for callers who cannot. It is tested
against the quickstarts so the two cannot drift.

**It carries no code and no secrets.** Agents, scorers and policies are named
(:class:`~agentdescent.workspec.Ref`) and resolved on the machine that runs the
spec, inside an import allowlist. Provider keys are read from the environment
by the adapters, never written into the spec -- a spec is saved beside the run,
shown to the user and logged, so anything in it is public.

The composition table -- what each ``kind`` assembles -- is
:data:`KIND_ROWS` and is meant to be read::

    kind        strategy       run                 propose          reward         layer
    text        SingleSlot     model(template)     reflector        scorer         L2
    skill_dir   FileTree       tree_runner         tree_reflector   scorer         L2
    agent_dir   FileTree       tree_runner         tree_reflector   scorer         L1
    agent_code  FileTree       code_runner         tree_reflector   gated_reward   L1
    plugin      FileTree       plugin_runner       tree_reflector   gated_reward   L1
    policy_slot SlotSpec       one inner search    slot_reflector   meta_reward    L1

``policy_slot`` is the odd one and the reason the table is worth reading: its
artifact is not a file but a *decision rule of the optimiser itself*, and one
rollout is a whole inner ``evolve()`` or tree search rather than one model call.
Because it is still an ``evolve()`` call, plan, cost, detach, status and watch
need nothing from it. ``show`` and ``apply`` do: the rendered value is source
text like ``kind: "text"``, but ``target`` names a *slot* rather than a file, so
there is nothing to diff against and ``apply`` has to be told a destination.
