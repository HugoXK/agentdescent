# API reference

Every name `agentdescent` exports, grouped by the module it comes from.
**Generated** from the package's own signatures and docstrings by
`python -m tools.gen_api_docs` — `tests/test_api_reference.py` fails if this
page and the code disagree, so a signature here is the signature you get.

A signature too long for its heading is printed in full below it, one
parameter per line, followed by a table of what each one does — type,
default, and the docstring's own prose. `*required*` in the default column
means the parameter has none.

Each section links to the page that explains *why* the module is shaped the
way it is; this page is the *what*.

## The loop

`evolve()`, the artifact, the actor, and what a run returns. &nbsp;·&nbsp; `agentdescent.evolution` &nbsp;·&nbsp; [guide](evolution.md)

### `Agent`

Convenience actor: bundles running a task and proposing an improvement.

### `EvolutionResult(...)`

```python
EvolutionResult(
    state: Dict[str, str],
    rendered: str,
    final_reward: float,
    history: List[RoundInfo],
    ledger_log: List[str],
    error: Optional[str] = None,
    stop_reason: str = 'rounds',
    forced_refreshes: int = 0,
    stragglers: int = 0,
    retired_workers: int = 0,
    audit_drained: int = 0,
    usage: Usage = <factory>,
    wallclock: float = 0.0,
    rollouts: int = 0,
    rollout_seconds: float = 0.0,
    eval_seconds: float = 0.0,

```

| method | what it does |
|---|---|
| `cost_summary() -> str` | One line: what the run cost. Complements `outcomes()`, which says why it went as it did. |
| `cost_to_quality(target: float) -> Optional[int]` | Rollouts spent up to the first round that reached `target`. |
| `duplicate_rate() -> float` | Cache hits as a fraction of lookups -- work that did *not* have to be redone. In one process this is memoisation working; across processes it is the figure that says how much a shared cache would be worth. |
| `fusion_stats() -> 'FusionStats'` | How often merging beat the best single diff -- and how badly it lost. |
| `gate_share() -> float` | How much of the merger's busy time went to evaluation, in `[0, 1]`. |
| `load(path: str) -> 'EvolutionResult'` | Read back a result written by `save`. |
| `merger_occupancy() -> float` | Merger busy time over wall-clock. Above ~0.8 it is the critical path. |
| `outcomes() -> Dict[str, int]` | Merge outcomes for the whole run, by category -- *why* it went as it did. |
| `save(path: str) -> None` | Write the evolved artifact and its run summary to a JSON file. |
| `stale_rate() -> float` | Discarded evidence as a fraction of evidence considered; 0.0 if none. |
| `time_to_quality(target: float) -> Optional[float]` | Wall-clock at the first round whose held-out reward reached `target`. |
| `write_to(...)` | Install a file-tree artifact back into a real directory. |

### `EvolvingArtifact(...)`

An `Evolvable`: flat state + a strategy.

```python
EvolvingArtifact(
    id: str,
    state: Optional[Dict[str, str]] = None,
    version: int = 1,
    blast_radius: float = 0.2,
    runtime: Optional['_Runtime'] = None,
    strategy: Optional[Strategy] = None
) -> None
```

| method | what it does |
|---|---|
| `cheap_eval(evidence: EvidenceCard) -> float` | Score this artifact on the trajectories an evidence card carries. |
| `evidence_eval(evidence: EvidenceCard) -> float` | Score this artifact on the trajectories an evidence card carries. |
| `full_eval(task_set: Sequence[Task]) -> Dict[str, float]` | Score on a task set. No longer part of the `Evolvable` protocol -- the engine reaches ground truth through the verifier's `eval_fn` -- and kept because it is a convenient thing for a caller to have. |
| `score(tasks: Sequence[Task]) -> float` | Mean reward over `tasks`, evaluated concurrently. |
| `score_bounded(tasks: Sequence[Task], floor: float) -> float` | Mean reward, abandoned once it **provably** cannot exceed `floor`. |

### `FusionStats(...)`

The fusion tournament's record, with every denominator it needs.

```python
FusionStats(
    trials: int = 0,
    contested: int = 0,
    unranked: int = 0,
    single_candidate: int = 0,
    contradiction: int = 0,
    nothing_to_fuse: int = 0,
    dominant_single: int = 0,
    synthesis_failed: int = 0,
    synthesized_wins: int = 0,
    fused_wins: int = 0,
    single_wins: int = 0,
    neither: int = 0,
    ties: int = 0,
    mean_gain: float = 0.0,
    negative: int = 0,
    mean_loss: float = 0.0,
    worst_loss: float = 0.0,
    below_baseline: int = 0
) -> None
```

| method | what it does |
|---|---|
| `summary() -> str` | One line, and it says when there is nothing to report. |

### `LLMAgent(...)`

Adapt a `Completion` (from `agents`) into an `Agent`.

```python
LLMAgent(
    complete: Completion,
    solve_template: str = 'You are executing an artifact defined below.\n\n{artifact}\n\nApply it to this input and output ONLY the result, nothing else.\n\nInput:\n{prompt}',
    propose_template: str = "The artifact just failed a task (score {reward:.2f} out of 1.0).\n\nArtifact so far:\n{artifact}\n\nTask input:\n{prompt}\n\nIt produced:\n{output}\n{expected}\nPropose exactly ONE concise, general rule (a single imperative sentence) to improve the artifact for this and similar cases. State the rule in general terms -- it will be applied to other tasks, so do NOT mention this task's specific values or answer. Output only the rule text, or NONE if no rule would help.",
    show_meta: bool = True,
    meta_chars: int = 600,
    _empty_replies: int = 0
) -> None
```

### `ProposalContractError`

`propose` returned something that is not text (or `None`).

### `RewardContractError`

The caller's `reward` returned something outside the documented contract.

### `RoundInfo(...)`

```python
RoundInfo(
    round: int,
    held_out_reward: float,
    n_items: int,
    committed: int,
    rejected: int,
    reasons: Dict[str, int] = <factory>,
    elapsed_s: float = 0.0,
    rollouts: int = 0,
    calls: int = 0,
    tokens: int = 0,
    considered: int = 0,
    discarded_stale: int = 0,
    conflicts_dropped: int = 0,
    fused: int = 0
) -> None
```

### `Task(id: str, prompt: str, meta: Dict[str, Any] = <factory>) -> None`

One unit of work the artifact is evaluated on.

### `claude_agent(model: str = 'claude-opus-4-8', max_tokens: int = 1024) -> LLMAgent`

Convenience: `LLMAgent(claude(model))` (provider code lives in `agents`).

### `evolve(...)`

Evolve an artifact. Provide either `agent` (with `solve`/`propose`) or the `run` / `propose` callables directly.

```python
evolve(
    tasks: Sequence[Task],
    reward: Reward,
    *,
    agent: Optional[Agent] = None,

    verbose: bool = False,
    usage: Optional[Usage] = None,
    policies: Optional['Policies'] = None
) -> EvolutionResult
```

| parameter | type | default | what it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tasks` | `Sequence[Task]` | *required* | The work the artifact is evaluated on. Split into train / held-out **by position** -- the last `held_out_frac` of the sequence is held out, in the order given. At least 4 are required and ids must be unique. |
| `reward` | `Reward` | *required* | `(task, output) -> [0, 1]`. Scores in `[0, 1]`; the engine treats `>= solved_threshold` as a pass (no proposal is requested). |
| `agent` | `Optional[Agent]` | `None` | An object with `solve` + `propose`. Provide this **or** `run` and `propose`; both signatures are checked before the first rollout. |
| `run` | `Optional[Run]` | `None` | `run(rendered, task) -> output` and `propose(rendered, task, output, reward) -> str \| None`. |
| `propose` | `Optional[Propose]` | `None` | As `run`. |
| `strategy` | `Optional[Strategy]` | `None` | How the artifact is represented and how a proposal becomes a `Diff`. |
| `parallel` | `Optional['ParallelStrategy']` | `None` | How a round's tasks are partitioned across workers. `DataParallel` (default) shards them; `TensorParallel(n_sections, keys=, route=)` also gives each worker a disjoint **section of the artifact** and rejects out-of-section edits -- counted as `section-violation` in `outcomes`. The pairing is validated before the first rollout: a strategy with no declared key space (`AppendRules`) or fewer keys than sections is refused rather than silently dropping most of its proposals. `PipelineParallel` raises (see above). |
| `task_sampler` | `Optional['TaskSampler']` | `None` | **Which** task a worker rolls out next, from its shard. Defaults to `RoundRobin`; use `DifficultyWeighted` to spend rollouts on tasks that still carry a learning signal. |
| `initial_state` | `Optional[Dict[str, str]]` | `None` | Seed the artifact instead of starting from `strategy.initial()`. Ignored when resuming an existing `repo_path`. |
| `blast_radius` | `float` | `0.2` | Governance layer, in `[0, 1]` (see above). |
| `artifact_id` | `str` | `'artifact'` | Name of the evolving artifact; becomes a filename, so it must match `[A-Za-z0-9_.-]+`. |
| `rounds` | `int` | `15` | Number of round barriers to run. Under `asynchronous=True` this becomes a worker-rollout budget of `rounds * n_workers` instead. |
| `n_workers` | `int` | `4` | Workers per round (`>= 1`). |
| `max_concurrency` | `int` | `1` | How many of them actually run at once (see above). |
| `refresh_interval` | `int` | `1` | How many rounds a worker keeps its ledger snapshot before taking the round's fresh one. `1` (default) is what this loop always did: every worker proposes against the current head, so a diff's staleness `eta` is **0 by construction** -- and that made `staleness_policy=` a knob with nothing to decide on this path (measured over an 8-round run: all 15 staleness decisions saw `eta=0` and returned ACCEPT, so Full, Guarded and Reflective were indistinguishable). Above `1`, workers hold a spread of versions -- the refresh is staggered by worker id -- so their diffs arrive with a spread of `eta` and the staleness policy, the `alpha` tolerances in `agg_config` and the `all-stale` outcome all become reachable synchronously. Costs no extra ledger read: a worker either adopts the snapshot the round already took, or keeps the older one it has. Ignored under `asynchronous=True`, where the lag budget is `async_ratio`. |
| `round_timeout` | `Optional[float]` | `None` | Seconds a round will wait for its concurrent workers before giving up on the slow ones. `None` (default) waits forever, which is what you want when every rollout is bounded -- but a single hung rollout then stalls the run, because the aggregator is a barrier. Abandoned work keeps running in the background (Python cannot cancel a thread) and is simply not waited for; it is reported when `verbose`. Only applies when `max_concurrency > 1`. |
| `target_reward` | `Optional[float]` | `None` | Stop as soon as held-out reward reaches this. Without it a run always spends all `rounds`, including after it has converged -- measured at 43% of rollouts wasted on an artifact that had stopped changing. |
| `patience` | `Optional[int]` | `None` | Stop after this many consecutive rounds with no improvement in held-out reward. `None` disables it. Cheap insurance for a run that plateaus below `target_reward`. |
| `max_worker_errors` | `int` | `3` | How much total failure to tolerate before giving up -- and only while *no* worker has ever completed a rollout, which reads as a misconfiguration (wrong key, dead endpoint). Once any worker has succeeded the backend demonstrably works, so failures are treated as transient and the run continues on whatever evidence it did gather. Counts consecutive failed rollouts per worker on the async path (see `result.retired_workers`) and consecutive rounds in which *every* worker failed on the sync path. |
| `eval_concurrency` | `int` | `8` | How many held-out tasks to score at once. Every gate goes through this -- each round's measurement and, far more often, the aggregator's per-candidate comparisons -- so it is the merge half of the run's parallelism, independent of `n_workers`. `1` restores the old sequential behaviour. |
| `asynchronous` | `bool` | `False` | Delegate to `async_evolve` -- no round barrier, with `async_ratio` as the staleness lag budget. |
| `async_ratio` | `int` | `3` | As `asynchronous`. |
| `resync_on_commit` | `bool` | `True` | Asynchronous path only. Refresh every worker's snapshot as soon as a sweep commits, so no one *starts* a rollout against a superseded artifact. See `async_evolve`, which documents what it does and does not fix -- a commit landing mid-rollout still produces a stale card. |
| `pipelined_gate` | `bool` | `False` | Under `asynchronous=True`, run a merge's **measurement** phase on its own threads instead of on the merger, so the merger goes back to draining while the gate runs. Off by default; documented in full on `async_evolve`, which implements it. Warns and does nothing on the synchronous path, where the round barrier idles every worker for the whole merge regardless. |
| `gate_workers` | `int` | `2` | As `pipelined_gate`. |
| `max_seconds` | `Optional[float]` | `None` | Wall-clock budget. `None` (default) means unbounded; the async path uses `20.0` when unset. |
| `max_rollouts` | `Optional[int]` | `None` | The budget in the two units a comparison has to hold fixed: rollouts completed, and actor invocations (`run` + `propose`). `rounds` is not one of them -- configurations differ in how much model a round buys, so a budget fixed in rounds hands the wider configuration more model and then reports the extra model as a win for parallelism. Either bound stops the run with `stop_reason` `"max_rollouts"` / `"max_calls"`. **Checked at the round barrier, so a run overshoots by up to one round.** A round is dispatched or it is not; stopping halfway would leave a half-merged round, and the states a comparison compares are the ones a merge produced. So a budget is a *bound on where to stop*, never the number to compare on: read the spend the run actually reported (`result.rollouts`, `result.usage.calls`), which is what `baselines` does -- it refuses to call two arms equal-budget when their measured spends differ. The async path has no barrier and enforces both per rollout, so it overshoots by at most the rollouts already in flight. |
| `max_calls` | `Optional[int]` | `None` | As `max_rollouts`. |
| `max_tokens` | `Optional[int]` | `None` | Hard cap on total tokens consumed (`prompt_tokens + completion_tokens`). A reasoning model can spend 40k tokens on hidden thinking in one call, so `max_calls` and `max_rollouts` do not bound cost: a 20-round run with 4 workers is 80 rollouts and ~160 model calls, but at 40k tokens each that is 6.4M tokens -- the bill, not the count, is what a deployment needs to control. Checked at the round barrier alongside the other budgets; the async path checks per-rollout for tighter control. Stops with `stop_reason="max_tokens"`. `None` (default) means unbounded. |
| `stop_on_diminishing_returns` | `bool` | `False` | Stop when the run's own return per token has fallen off its peak by more than `efficiency_floor`. The economic rule: keep buying compute while it pays, stop when it does not -- *even with budget left*. Off by default, because a run whose reward only rises late would be cut short by it, and because it needs `max_tokens` (return per token needs a cost to divide by). Stops with `stop_reason="diminishing_returns"`. |
| `efficiency_floor` | `float` | `0.25` | How far below the peak counts as diminishing, when the stop above is on. Self-calibrating against the run's own best rate, so it is a *ratio*, not an absolute quantity: a reward is in `[0, 1]` and a token count is in the millions, and their quotient has no interpretable scale. |
| `call_budget` | `Optional['CallBudget']` | `None` | An adaptive per-call thinking budget (o1-style test-time scaling). Pass a `CallBudget` whose `base` matches the adapter's configured `max_tokens`, and the engine adjusts the per-call ceiling based on each parent's score and the remaining budget — promising parents get more thinking, dead-end ones get less, and the allocation tightens as the token budget is spent. The adapter must be wrapped with `budgeted_completion` for this to reach it. `None` (default) means the per-call ceiling is the adapter's own and never changes. |
| `self_verify` | `bool` | `True` | Re-run the trajectory with the diff applied to record a local before/after delta. Doubles the rollouts spent per proposal; ports that score candidates only on held-out should pass `False`. |
| `held_out_frac` | `float` | `0.4` | Fraction of `tasks` reserved for held-out scoring, in `(0, 1)`. |
| `repo_path` | `Optional[str]` | `None` | Where the git-backed ledger lives. Omit for a throwaway repo that is removed when this call returns (not held until interpreter exit, so a sweep does not accumulate one git repo per run); **passing the same path again resumes** that ledger, and a caller-supplied path is never deleted. Git runs with an isolated config, so a personal `~/.gitconfig` (`commit.gpgsign`, `core.hooksPath`) cannot fail the ledger's own bookkeeping commits. |
| `checkpointing` | `bool` | `False` | Save the aggregator's in-memory **search** state to `<repo_path>/checkpoints/` after every round, so a later run on the same `repo_path` resumes the search instead of re-deriving it from the ledger head. `repo_path` alone already resumes the *artifact*; what it cannot carry is what the search learned on the way there -- Beta posteriors, a population archive and its `selected` counts, the early-stop patience counter. Off by default, because a run that never resumes (a scratch repo, a tempdir) would pay the serialise-and-write for nothing, and because an aggregator opts in by implementing `checkpoint()` / `restore()` at all -- one without them is unaffected either way. A checkpoint that cannot be written or read (state that does not serialise, a lock another process holds, a full disk) is skipped, never raised: the cost of a missing checkpoint is a resume that starts the search fresh, which is what `False` does. |
| `agg_config` | `Optional[AggregatorConfig]` | `None` | Tuning for the reference aggregator (batching, acceptance risk, trust region, staleness tolerance). |
| `staleness_policy` | `Optional[StalenessPolicy]` | `None` | What to do with a diff proposed against an out-of-date version -- `full` / `guarded` (default) / `reflective`. |
| `aggregator_factory` | `Optional[AggregatorFactory]` | `None` | Replace the optimizer entirely; receives `(ledger, verifier, audit, config, staleness_policy)`. |
| `oracle_budget` | `int` | `200` | Hard cap on full held-out oracle evaluations during audits. Once spent, the verifier falls back to its cheap layer -- which only saves anything when `cheap_eval_tasks` makes that layer genuinely cheaper, so the two knobs go together. |
| `cheap_eval_tasks` | `Optional[int]` | `None` | How many held-out tasks the *cheap* layer scores when the aggregator is merely **ranking** candidates -- conflict resolution, and the fusion tournament when it is on. `None` (default) is **8**, or the whole held-out set when that is smaller. It used to mean the whole set unconditionally, which made the cheap layer cost exactly what the oracle costs: ranking one candidate bought a full sweep of real agent calls, and `oracle_budget`'s fallback saved nothing because it was the same measurement. Nothing in `bench/` or `examples/` ever passed this, so every real run paid it. The cost of the new default is **ranking resolution**: 8 binary-scored tasks resolve 0.125, so two candidates closer than that are ordered by whichever the sample happens to favour. That is bounded to *which* candidate goes forward -- both commit gates read `eval_counts` on the full set, so it cannot decide whether a change is safe. Pass `len(held_out)` to restore the exact behaviour. The sample is fixed for the run, so candidates are always compared like-for-like. |
| `fusion_tournament` | `Optional[bool]` | `None` | Rank the surviving diffs against their fusion before putting one forward. `None` (default) defers to `agg_config`, which is **off**. Off, because the ranking is paid every round while the only decision it changes from the acceptance gate's is recoverable: the union is a superset of every single diff, so committing it unranked loses no proposal. `DefaultFusion` carries the case analysis. On, because it is the only way to *measure* `win_rate` -- `best_single_score` exists only where a single was actually scored. That number is a property of the workload, not of the mechanism, so it is worth measuring per workload and not worth paying for on every run. |
| `solved_threshold` | `float` | `0.999` | A reward at or above this counts as solved, so no proposal is requested and the task sampler counts a pass. The default (`SOLVED`, 0.999) is right for a binary scorer. **Lower it for a graded one** -- a ROUGE score or an LLM judge rarely reaches 0.999, so every rollout would ask the reflector to "fix" an answer that scored 0.95, and the run reports `below-threshold` as if the reflector were the problem. |
| `shuffle` | `bool` | `False` | Shuffle `tasks` before that positional split. Off by default, which keeps a run reproducible and keeps `val_frac`'s promise that the engine's held-out split is exactly that `Dataset`'s `val`. Turn it on for **grouped** data -- anything ordered by category, source, difficulty or date -- where the tail of the file is a different distribution from the head, and every gate in the run (the acceptance test, `target_reward`, `final_reward`) would then be measured against it. |
| `seed` | `int` | `0` | As `shuffle`. |
| `on_round` | `Optional[Callable[['RoundInfo'], None]]` | `None` | Called with each `RoundInfo` as the round completes -- progress for a long run, which otherwise reports nothing until it returns. An exception raised here is reported but does not abort the run. |
| `stop_when` | `Optional[Callable[['RoundInfo'], bool]]` | `None` | Called after `on_round` with the same `RoundInfo`; return `True` to end the run with `stop_reason="stop_when"`. This is the seam for a budget the engine does not know how to count -- dollars from a shared `Usage`, an external deadline, a kill file. It is asked where `max_seconds` / `max_calls` are, so it stops between rounds and never mid-merge, and the run keeps what it has committed. An exception raised here is reported, not fatal. |
| `verbose` | `bool` | `False` | Print a line per round. Independent of the `RuntimeWarning` emitted when a run ends early -- that always fires. |
| `usage` | `Optional[Usage]` | `None` | Share one `Usage` with your model adapters (`claude(usage=u)`, `openai_compatible(usage=u)`) and the result's token counts become real. Without it the run still reports calls, seconds and failures -- `run` is `(rendered, task) -> str`, so an opaque actor has no way to surface tokens, and inventing a number would be worse than reporting zero. |
| `policies` | `Optional['Policies']` | `None` | Bundle of replaceable pieces (`Policies`). Every field defaults to `None` meaning "current behaviour", so `Policies()` and passing nothing are the same run. The individual keyword arguments -- `task_sampler`, `staleness_policy`, `aggregator_factory` -- are shortcuts onto its fields and keep working; an explicit argument wins over a bundle default rather than being silently ignored. Fields whose implementations have not landed yet raise rather than being accepted and ignored: a caller who passes a custom acceptance rule and sees a finished run would reasonably conclude it ran. New capabilities go here rather than adding another parameter to a function that already has thirty-five. |

### `reflector(...)`

Use any model as the *reflector* for an agent you already have.

```python
reflector(
    complete: Completion,
    template: str = "The artifact just failed a task (score {reward:.2f} out of 1.0).\n\nArtifact so far:\n{artifact}\n\nTask input:\n{prompt}\n\nIt produced:\n{output}\n{expected}\nPropose exactly ONE concise, general rule (a single imperative sentence) to improve the artifact for this and similar cases. State the rule in general terms -- it will be applied to other tasks, so do NOT mention this task's specific values or answer. Output only the rule text, or NONE if no rule would help.",
    show_meta: bool = True
) -> Propose
```

### `tasks_from(...)`

Turn a list of dicts -- a dataset -- into `Task` objects.

```python
tasks_from(
    rows,
    prompt: str = 'prompt',
    gold: str = 'gold',
    id: Optional[str] = None,
    **meta_keys: str
) -> List['Task']
```

Evolve a decision slot of `evolve()` itself, and validate it elsewhere. &nbsp;·&nbsp; `agentdescent.meta` &nbsp;·&nbsp; [guide](meta-evolution.md)

### `MetaOutcome(...)`

What one inner run did under a candidate slot value.

```python
MetaOutcome(
    curve: List[float] = <factory>,
    final: float = 0.0,
    rollouts: int = 0,
    detail: Dict[str, Any] = <factory>
) -> None
```

| method | what it does |
|---|---|
| `from_result(result: EvolutionResult, **detail: Any) -> 'MetaOutcome'` | Read an inner `EvolutionResult`. |

### `ParamSlot(...)`

The numeric hyper-parameters of any policy class, one key each.

```python
ParamSlot(
    factory: Callable[..., Any],
    params: Mapping[str, float],
    bounds: Mapping[str, Tuple[float, float]] = <factory>,
    title: str = '# Policy parameters',
    invalid_proposals: int = 0,
    _lock: threading.Lock = <factory>
) -> None
```

### `PrioritySelection(...)`

A `SelectionPolicy` driven by a `priority` rule.

```python
PrioritySelection(
    source: str = 'def priority(rank, visits, total, prior, depth, n_nodes):\n    # Flat PUCT (ERA, futs.py): exploit by rank, explore by visit count.\n    c = 1.0\n    return rank + c * (1.0 / n_nodes) * math.sqrt(total) / (1 + visits)\n'
) -> None
```

### `SlotSpec`

A `Strategy` that also compiles.

### `SourceSlot(...)`

One slot of validated source, compiled by `build`.

```python
SourceSlot(
    initial_value: str = '',
    key: str = 'value',
    empty_render: str = '(no instruction yet)',
    min_chars: int = 1,
    validate: Optional[Callable[[str], str]] = None,
    build: Optional[Callable[[str], Any]] = None,
    description: str = 'The value is source text; reply with the complete revised text.',
    invalid_proposals: int = 0,
    _lock: threading.Lock = <factory>
) -> None
```

| method | what it does |
|---|---|
| `accepts(proposal: str) -> Tuple[bool, str]` | Would `to_diff` take this proposal? `(accepted, reason)`. |

### `auc(outcome: MetaOutcome) -> float`

Mean best-so-far held-out reward over the inner run: how *fast* it rose.

### `compile_policy_source(...)`

Gate `source`, instantiate its `class_name`, and check it fits `slot`.

```python
compile_policy_source(
    slot: str,
    source: str,
    *,
    class_name: str = 'Policy',
    smoke: Optional[Callable[[Any], None]] = None,
    rng_seed: Optional[int] = None
) -> Any
```

### `compile_priority(source: str) -> Callable[..., float]`

AST-gate `source` and return its `priority` function.

### `evolve_problem(...)`

An inner `evolve()` as a `Problem`.

```python
evolve_problem(
    tasks: Sequence[Task],
    reward: Callable[[Task, str], float],
    *,
    slot: str,
    base: Optional[Policies] = None,
    **evolve_kwargs: Any
) -> Problem
```

### `final_reward(outcome: MetaOutcome) -> float`

The inner run's own final held-out reward, clipped to `[0, 1]`.

### `meta_evolve(...)`

Evolve one decision slot of the engine against a set of inner problems.

```python
meta_evolve(
    problems: Union[Sequence[Problem], Mapping[str, Problem]],
    *,
    slot: str,
    spec: SlotSpec,
    propose: Optional[Callable[[str, Task, str, float], Optional[str]]] = None,
    model: Optional[Completion] = None,
    meta_reward: Optional[MetaReward] = None,
    seeds: Sequence[int] = (0,),
    blast_radius: float = 0.6,
    artifact_id: str = 'policy-slot',
    **evolve_kwargs: Any
) -> EvolutionResult
```

| parameter | type | default | what it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| `problems` | `Union[Sequence[Problem], Mapping[str, Problem]]` | *required* | The inner problems, each `(value, seed) -> MetaOutcome` -- a list, or a mapping from a name to a problem (the name appears in task ids and in the reflector's prompt). `evolve_problem` builds one from the arguments of an inner `evolve()`. |
| `slot` | `str` | *required* | Which `Policies` field the value fills; one of `SLOTS`. Recorded, and checked -- machinery fields refuse. |
| `spec` | `SlotSpec` | *required* | How a value is represented, gated and compiled -- a `SlotSpec` such as `priority_selection` or a `ParamSlot`. |
| `propose` | `Optional[Callable[[str, Task, str, float], Optional[str]]]` | `None` | The reflector. Pass `propose` directly, or `model` to get `slot_reflector` over the spec. One of the two is required. |
| `model` | `Optional[Completion]` | `None` | As `propose`. |
| `meta_reward` | `Optional[MetaReward]` | `None` | `MetaOutcome` to `[0, 1]`; `None` is `auc`. |
| `seeds` | `Sequence[int]` | `(0,)` | Inner seeds per problem; each `(problem, seed)` pair is one outer task, so `len(problems) * len(seeds)` tasks in all, split into train and held-out by `held_out_frac` as `evolve()` always does. |
| `blast_radius` | `float` | `0.6` | Governance. `0.6` is L1: the value is a harness and every merge also passes the oracle. |
| `artifact_id` | `str` | `'policy-slot'` | As `blast_radius`. |
| `**evolve_kwargs` | `Any` |  | Everything else `evolve` takes -- `rounds`, `n_workers`, `max_concurrency`, `held_out_frac`, `max_rollouts` ... `strategy`, `run` and `reward` are this function's and cannot be passed. Returns the ordinary `EvolutionResult`; `spec.compile(result.rendered)` is the evolved value, and `result.rendered` is what to hand `meta_validate`. |

### `meta_validate(...)`

Score `before` and `after` on problems the outer loop never saw.

```python
meta_validate(
    spec: SlotSpec,
    before: str,
    after: str,
    problems: Union[Sequence[Problem], Mapping[str, Problem]],

    seeds: Sequence[int] = (0,),
    meta_reward: Optional[MetaReward] = None
) -> Dict[str, Dict[str, float]]
```

### `policy_source(...)`

The general spec: `slot`'s value is the source of a class satisfying its Protocol.

```python
policy_source(
    slot: str,
    seed: Optional[str] = None,
    *,
    class_name: str = 'Policy',
    smoke: Optional[Callable[[Any], None]] = None,
    notes: str = ''
) -> SourceSlot
```

### `priority_selection(...)`

The shipped spec for the `selection` slot of a tree search.

```python
priority_selection(
    seed: str = 'def priority(rank, visits, total, prior, depth, n_nodes):\n    # Flat PUCT (ERA, futs.py): exploit by rank, explore by visit count.\n    c = 1.0\n    return rank + c * (1.0 / n_nodes) * math.sqrt(total) / (1 + visits)\n'
) -> SourceSlot
```

### `rollouts_to(target: float) -> MetaReward`

`1 / (1 + sweeps until the curve first reaches target)`; 0 if never.

### `seed_source(slot: str) -> str`

A valid starting value for `slot`, as candidate source.

### `slot_reflector(...)`

A `propose` for `meta_evolve`: one model call per failing rollout.

```python
slot_reflector(
    complete: Completion,
    spec: SlotSpec,
    *,
    max_outcome_chars: int = 2000
) -> Callable[[str, Task, str, float], Optional[str]]
```

### `transfer_ratio(...)`

Gain on `target` over gain on `source`, from a `meta_validate` report.

```python
transfer_ratio(
    report: Mapping[str, Mapping[str, float]],
    source: str,
    target: str
) -> Optional[float]
```

## The ledger

The git-backed, compare-and-swap artifact store. &nbsp;·&nbsp; `agentdescent.ledger` &nbsp;·&nbsp; [guide](ledger.md)

### `CASConflict`

Raised when a commit's declared base version is stale.

### `ContractRejected`

Raised when a commit would change an artifact's contract major.

### `GitError`

A git command failed; the message carries git's own stderr.

### `Ledger(...)`

A git-backed, version-vectored artifact store with dual branches.

```python
Ledger(
    repo_path: str,
    serialize: Serializer,
    deserialize: Deserializer,
    author: str = 'agentdescent <bot@agentdescent.local>'
) -> None
```

| method | what it does |
|---|---|
| `close() -> None` | Refuse further use of this ledger. Idempotent. |
| `commit(...)` | Compare-and-swap commit of a single artifact. |
| `commit_atomic(...)` | Two-phase, all-or-nothing commit of several artifacts. |
| `fork(name: str, from_branch: str = 'dev') -> str` | Create or reset `name` to hold `from_branch`'s current state. |
| `live_heads() -> List[str]` | Every live head branch: `dev` first, then the `dev/` forks. |
| `promote_to_stable(artifact_id: str) -> Optional[int]` | EMA-style confirmation: copy dev's current artifact onto stable. |
| `register(artifact: Evolvable, branch: str = 'dev') -> None` | Add a brand-new artifact at version 1 on both branches. |
| `snapshot(branch: str = 'dev') -> Snapshot` | Materialize every artifact on `branch` into live Evolvables. |

### `Snapshot(artifacts: Dict[str, Evolvable], version: VersionVector) -> None`

An immutable view of one branch at one point in time.

## The verifier

Rule / learned / oracle, and the budget that bounds the expensive one. &nbsp;·&nbsp; `agentdescent.verifier` &nbsp;·&nbsp; [guide](verifier.md)

### `ThreeLayerVerifier(...)`

Rule / learned / full backend for the aggregator.

```python
ThreeLayerVerifier(
    eval_fn: EvalFn,
    held_out: Sequence,
    rule_subset: int = 8,
    learned_noise: float = 0.04,
    seed: int = 0,
    budget: VerifierBudget = <factory>
) -> None
```

| method | what it does |
|---|---|
| `cheap_eval(artifact: Evolvable) -> float` | The signal used everywhere a budget-free score is needed. |
| `eval_counts(artifact: Evolvable, floor: Optional[float] = None) -> Tuple[float, float]` | Return (successes, failures) on the full held-out set. |
| `full_eval(artifact: Evolvable) -> float` | `eval_fn` on the **whole** held-out set. Consumes audit budget. |
| `learned_eval(artifact: Evolvable) -> Tuple[float, float]` | Noisy proxy that also returns an uncertainty estimate. |
| `oracle_eval(artifact: Evolvable) -> float` | Deprecated alias for `full_eval`. Removed in 0.7. |
| `rule_eval(artifact: Evolvable) -> float` | Cheap, deterministic-ish check on a tiny subset. |

### `VerifierBudget(oracle_calls_remaining: int = 200, oracle_calls_used: int = 0) -> None`

Budget for full-set evaluations, consumed by `full_eval`.

---

## The sparse audit layer

Pair a cheap verifier against ground truth without paying for truth. &nbsp;·&nbsp; `agentdescent.audit.tap` &nbsp;·&nbsp; [guide](audit.md)

### `AuditedReward(...)`

A cheap verifier that hands a sampled minority of its work to the truth.

```python
AuditedReward(
    verifier: Callable[[Any, str], float],
    *,
    oracle: Optional[Any] = None,
    store: Optional[AuditStore] = None,
    draw_by: str = 'task',
    sample_rate: float = 0.1,
    stratify: Optional[Callable[[Any, str, float], str]] = None,
    rates: Optional[Dict[str, float]] = None,
    calibration_fraction: float = 0.7,
    seed: int = 0,
    verifier_version: Optional[str] = None,
    version_extra: Any = None
) -> None
```

| parameter | type | default | what it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| `verifier` | `Callable[[Any, str], float]` | *required* | The cheap scorer the loop optimises against -- an agent judging the output, a learned scorer, a heuristic. `(task, output) -> float`. |
| `oracle` | `Optional[Any]` | `None` | Ground truth. `GoldAnswer` when it returns now, `DeferredOracle` when it arrives later. Defaults to `NullOracle`, which still records the questions -- useful when the answerer has not been asked yet. |
| `store` | `Optional[AuditStore]` | `None` | Where records go. Defaults to an in-memory store; pass `AuditStore("audit.jsonl")` to keep them. |
| `draw_by` | `str` | `'task'` | What the inclusion draw is a function of. `"task"` (the default) audits a task **whole or not at all**; `"output"` draws per unit. They are identical when each task is scored once, and differ exactly where the difference matters. A run scores the same task again for every artifact version, and a per-unit draw then puts that task in *both* the labelled and the unlabelled half -- which the estimator assumes cannot happen. Measured at a nominal 0.95, on 200 tasks scored under four versions each: coverage **0.9125** when the halves share tasks and **0.945** when they do not. `"output"` buys more distinct tasks per label and an interval about 15% too narrow. Use it only when a task is scored once, where it is the same thing. |
| `sample_rate` | `float` | `0.1` | Probability a unit is audited, when no stratum-specific rate applies. |
| `stratify` | `Optional[Callable[[Any, str, float], str]]` | `None` | Optional `(task, output, verifier_score) -> str`. Names the layer a unit belongs to, so `rates` can spend more of the budget where the residual varies most. The stratum is recorded either way. |
| `rates` | `Optional[Dict[str, float]]` | `None` | Per-stratum inclusion probabilities, falling back to `sample_rate`. |
| `calibration_fraction` | `float` | `0.7` | Share of audited units assigned `CALIBRATION`; the rest become `IMPROVEMENT`. The split is drawn at random rather than taken in order, because units arrive grouped by task and by artifact and any ordered split would correlate the two pools with whatever the ordering happens to encode. |
| `seed` | `int` | `0` | Base seed for the inclusion draw. |
| `verifier_version` | `Optional[str]` | `None` | Overrides the fingerprint derived from `verifier`. Pass one when the verifier is an agent whose behaviour lives in a prompt or a model id rather than in the source of the function. |
| `version_extra` | `Any` | `None` | Mixed into the derived fingerprint. The cheaper way to say the same thing: `version_extra={"model": "...", "prompt_sha": "..."}`. |

| method | what it does |
|---|---|
| `calibration_set() -> list` | Resolved CALIBRATION records for *this* verifier version. |
| `pending() -> list` | Audited units still waiting on truth. |

### `RenderTap(run: Callable[[str, Any], str]) -> None`

Optional wrapper for `run` that records *which* artifact produced an output.

---

## Switching the audit on

One call that assembles the six pieces and the four cross-references. &nbsp;·&nbsp; `agentdescent.audit.wiring` &nbsp;·&nbsp; [guide](audit.md)

### `Audit(...)`

The assembled layer. Hand the three fields to `evolve()`.

```python
Audit(
    reward: AuditedReward,
    run: Optional[RenderTap],
    acceptance: RectifiedAcceptance,
    store: AuditStore,
    calibrator: Calibrator,
    watch: VerifierWatch
) -> None
```

| method | what it does |
|---|---|
| `rebalance(unseen: float, **kw: Any) -> float` | Move the calibration share as the improvement pool stops learning. |
| `recompute() -> Rectification` | Re-read the store and re-estimate. Call after a batch resolves. |
| `rectification() -> Rectification` | The correction in force. Never raises; stale is an answer. |
| `status() -> Dict[str, Any]` | What the audit knows, for a round hook or a log line. |

### `attach(...)`

Assemble the audit around `verifier` and return what `evolve()` needs.

```python
attach(
    verifier: Callable[[Any, str], float],
    *,
    oracle: Optional[Any] = None,
    store: Union[AuditStore, str, None] = None,
    run: Optional[Callable[[str, Any], str]] = None,
    inner: Any = None,
    enabled: bool = True,
    plan: Optional[SamplePlan] = None,
    policy: Optional[AuditPolicy] = None,
    sample_rate: float = 0.1,
    stratify: Optional[Callable[[Any, str, float], str]] = None,
    calibration_fraction: float = 0.7,
    draw_by: str = 'task',
    seed: int = 0,
    verifier_version: Optional[str] = None,
    version_extra: Any = None,
    watch_ids: Iterable[str] = (),
    watch_globs: Sequence[str] = ()
) -> Audit
```

| parameter | type | default | what it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| `verifier` | `Callable[[Any, str], float]` | *required* | The cheap scorer the loop optimises against, `(task, output) -> float`. |
| `oracle` | `Optional[Any]` | `None` | Ground truth. A bare callable `(task, output) -> float` is wrapped in `GoldAnswer`, because that is what every caller with a gold answer already has and asking them to wrap it adds an import and a chance to forget that an oracle must never raise into the rollout. `None` records the questions without answering them. |
| `store` | `Union[AuditStore, str, None]` | `None` | An `AuditStore`, or a path to open one at. A path is the usual case: the process that resolves a deferred oracle is not this one. |
| `run` | `Optional[Callable[[str, Any], str]]` | `None` | The loop's `run`. Wrapped in a `RenderTap` so each unit records which artifact produced it. Leave it out and the audit still estimates the bias; it just cannot attribute a unit to an artifact. |
| `inner` | `Any` | `None` |  |
| `enabled` | `bool` | `True` | `False` collects records and **does not correct anything** -- the gate delegates to `inner` on the untouched context. The honest way to run a first round: measure before you spend. |
| `plan` | `Optional[SamplePlan]` | `None` | A `SamplePlan` from a previous round, which carries per-stratum rates and overrides `sample_rate`. |
| `policy` | `Optional[AuditPolicy]` | `None` |  |
| `sample_rate` | `float` | `0.1` |  |
| `stratify` | `Optional[Callable[[Any, str, float], str]]` | `None` |  |
| `calibration_fraction` | `float` | `0.7` |  |
| `draw_by` | `str` | `'task'` |  |
| `seed` | `int` | `0` |  |
| `verifier_version` | `Optional[str]` | `None` |  |
| `version_extra` | `Any` | `None` |  |
| `watch_ids` | `Iterable[str]` | `()` | Artifact ids and diff-key globs that mean the verifier changed. Nothing is watched by default, which is right for a fixed function and exactly wrong for a run that evolves its own judge -- see `VerifierWatch`. |
| `watch_globs` | `Sequence[str]` | `()` | As `watch_ids`. |

---

## Audit oracle sources

Where ground truth comes from, and how long it takes to arrive. &nbsp;·&nbsp; `agentdescent.audit.sources` &nbsp;·&nbsp; [guide](audit.md)

### `DeferredOracle(*, max_queued: Optional[int] = None) -> None`

Truth that arrives later: an experiment, a human, an overnight job.

| method | what it does |
|---|---|
| `forget(record_id: str) -> None` | Drop a resolved id from the queue view. |
| `queued() -> List[str]` | Record ids awaiting an answer, oldest first. |

### `GoldAnswer(fn: Callable[[object, str], float]) -> None`

Synchronous truth: a gold answer, an exact match, a checker, a simulator.

### `NullOracle()`

An oracle that never answers. The default, and it is not a no-op.

### `OracleSource`

Ground truth for one `(task, output)` pair.

### `resolve_from_mapping(store, answers: Dict[str, float], *, at: Optional[float] = None) -> int`

Fill in truth for many pending records at once. Returns how many landed.

---

## The audit store

Append-only persistence for paired observations, and the two pools. &nbsp;·&nbsp; `agentdescent.audit.store` &nbsp;·&nbsp; [guide](audit.md)

### `AuditStore(path: Optional[str] = None) -> None`

Records on disk, indexed in memory.

| method | what it does |
|---|---|
| `all() -> List[AuditRecord]` | Every record, in the order first seen. |
| `flush() -> None` | Persist the moments now. Call it when a run ends. |
| `for_calibration(verifier_version: str) -> List[AuditRecord]` | Resolved CALIBRATION records for one verifier version, and nothing else. |
| `for_improvement(verifier_version: Optional[str] = None) -> List[AuditRecord]` | Resolved IMPROVEMENT records -- the pool you are allowed to look at. |
| `load() -> None` | Re-read the file, last-occurrence-wins. |
| `observe_skipped(verifier_version: str, stratum: str) -> None` | Count one unit the tap dropped, without its score. |
| `observe_unlabelled(verifier_version: str, stratum: str, score: float) -> None` | Fold one un-audited score into its stratum's running moments. |
| `pending(...)` | Records still waiting on truth -- the work list for whoever answers. |
| `remember_fingerprint(fingerprint: str) -> None` | Persist the fingerprint so a restart can be compared against it. |
| `remember_priorities(priorities: Dict[str, float]) -> None` | Record what the merge path thought was worth auditing. |
| `reopen(record_id: str) -> bool` | Clear a resolution so it can be replaced. For corrections, not for retries. |
| `resolve(record_id: str, oracle_score: float, *, at: Optional[float] = None) -> bool` | Attach ground truth to a pending record. `False` if there was none to attach. |
| `unlabelled_moments(verifier_version: str)` | `stratum -> {n, mean, var, skipped}` over the units not audited. |
| `versions() -> List[str]` | Every `verifier_version` seen, in order of first appearance. |

### `summarise(records: Iterable[AuditRecord]) -> Dict[str, float]`

Counts and the raw mean residual. **Not** an estimate of the bias.

---

## Diagnosing the verifier

Sort the residual by what fixing it would cost, and measure a proposed fix. &nbsp;·&nbsp; `agentdescent.audit.diagnose` &nbsp;·&nbsp; [guide](audit.md)

### `Direction`

Which way the verifier was wrong.

| `SPEC_GAP` | `'spec_gap'` |
| `AMBIGUOUS` | `'ambiguous'` |
| `JUDGMENT` | `'judgment'` |
| `UNCLASSIFIED` | `'unclassified'` |

### `classify_disagreements(...)`

Sort a store's resolved disagreements by what fixing them would take.

```python
classify_disagreements(

) -> FixReport
```

### `reference_classifier(...)`

A classifier for the common case: a reference answer and a normaliser.

```python
reference_classifier(
    normalise: Callable[[str], str],
    reference_of: Callable[[Any], str],
    *,
    ambiguous_when: Optional[Callable[[str, str, Any], bool]] = None,

) -> Classifier
```

### `residual_stats(records: Iterable[AuditRecord]) -> Dict[str, float]`

---

## Searching for a fix

Enumerate the hard rules, score every combination, rank by the residual. &nbsp;·&nbsp; `agentdescent.audit.propose` &nbsp;·&nbsp; [guide](audit.md)

### `Candidate(rules: Tuple[str, ...], report: FixReport, passengers: Tuple[str, ...] = ()) -> None`

One combination of rules and what it does to the whole labelled set.

### `Rule(name: str, predicate: Predicate) -> None`

A named reason to mark an output wrong that the verifier marked right.

### `SearchReport(...)`

Every combination tried, best first, and the two things to distrust.

```python
SearchReport(
    sigma_before: float,
    candidates: List[Candidate] = <factory>,
    n_rules: int = 0,
    n_combinations: int = 0,
    floor: float = nan,
    warnings: List[str] = <factory>
) -> None
```

### `length_rules(...)`

Candidate rules that need only a reference and a normaliser.

```python
length_rules(
    normalise: Callable[[str], str],
    reference_of: Callable[[Any], str],
    *,
    question_of: Optional[Callable[[Any], str]] = None,
    short: Sequence[float] = (0.6, 0.4),
    long: Sequence[float] = (1.6, 3.0)
) -> List[Rule]
```

### `search(...)`

Score every combination of `rules` up to `max_size`, best first.

```python
search(
    records: Sequence[AuditRecord],
    rules: Sequence[Rule],
    context: Optional[Mapping[str, Any]] = None,
    *,
    max_size: int = 2,
    floor: float = nan,
    max_combinations: int = 200
) -> SearchReport
```

## The verifier scorecard

What has to be true before a new verifier replaces the old one. &nbsp;·&nbsp; `agentdescent.audit.scorecard` &nbsp;·&nbsp; [guide](audit.md)

### `Cost(verifier_seconds: float, oracle_seconds: float = nan) -> None`

Seconds per decision, for the verifier and for the thing it stands in for.

### `Goal`

Which way a metric is supposed to move.

| member | value |
|---|---|
| `LOWER` | `'lower is better'` |
| `HIGHER` | `'higher is better'` |
| `WATCH` | `'no target; read it'` |

### `Metric(...)`

One row. `previous` is `None` when there is nothing to compare to.

```python
Metric(
    name: str,
    value: float,
    goal: Goal,
    previous: Optional[float] = None,
    note: str = '',
    blocking: bool = False,
    triggered: bool = False
) -> None
```

### `RescanReport(...)`

What a new verifier would have said about outputs the run already scored.

```python
RescanReport(
    n: int,
    n_artifacts: int,
    agreement: float,
    mean_shift: float,
    sigma_shift: float,
    by_artifact: Dict[str, Dict[str, float]] = <factory>,
    flipped: List[Tuple[str, str, float, float]] = <factory>,
    n_pairs: int = 0,
    sigma_before: float = nan,
    sigma_after: float = nan
) -> None
```

### `Scorecard(...)`

The rows, and whether they add up to a change worth making.

```python
Scorecard(
    version: str,
    previous_version: Optional[str],
    metrics: List[Metric],
    blockers: List[str] = <factory>,
    notes: List[str] = <factory>,
    rescan: Optional[RescanReport] = None,
    rank: Optional[RankReport] = None,
    computed_at: float = 0.0
) -> None
```

### `rescan(...)`

Re-score the outputs the audit kept, and see what would have moved.

```python
rescan(
    records: Sequence[AuditRecord],
    new_verifier: Callable[[AuditRecord, Any], float],
    context: Optional[Mapping[str, Any]] = None,
    *,
    pairs: Optional[Sequence[Tuple[str, str]]] = None
) -> RescanReport
```

### `verifier_scorecard(...)`

Fill the card for `current`, against `previous` where there is one.

```python
verifier_scorecard(
    current: Rectification,
    records: Sequence[AuditRecord],
    *,
    previous: Optional[Rectification] = None,
    previous_records: Sequence[AuditRecord] = (),

    rank: Optional[RankReport] = None,
    cost: Optional[Cost] = None,
    previous_cost: Optional[Cost] = None,
    max_false_negative: float = 0.05,
    max_cost_ratio: float = 0.25
) -> Scorecard
```

---

## Ordering agreement

Can the verifier put candidates in the right order -- the only thing the gate uses. &nbsp;·&nbsp; `agentdescent.audit.ranking` &nbsp;·&nbsp; [guide](audit.md)

### `Flip(...)`

One artifact pair the verifier orders backwards.

```python
Flip(
    base: str,
    candidate: str,
    verifier_gap: float,
    oracle_gap: float,
    n_base: int,
    n_candidate: int
) -> None
```

### `RankReport(...)`

Ordering agreement, at the unit level and at the level the gate acts on.

```python
RankReport(
    n_units: int,
    tau_b: float,
    concordant: int,
    discordant: int,
    one_directional: bool,
    n_artifacts: int,
    by_artifact: Dict[str, Dict[str, float]] = <factory>,
    n_pairs: int = 0,
    compared: Tuple[Tuple[str, str], ...] = (),
    agree: int = 0,
    ties: int = 0,
    flips: List[Flip] = <factory>
) -> None
```

| method | what it does |
|---|---|
| `above(gap: float) -> Tuple[int, int]` | `(agree, flip)` among pairs whose *verifier* gap is at least `gap`. |

### `kendall_tau_b(x: Sequence[float], y: Sequence[float]) -> Tuple[float, int, int]`

`(tau_b, concordant, discordant)`, tie-corrected.

### `rank_agreement(...)`

Does the verifier order units, and artifacts, the way ground truth does?

```python
rank_agreement(
    records: Iterable[AuditRecord],
    *,
    pairs: Optional[Sequence[Tuple[str, str]]] = None,
    min_units: int = 1
) -> RankReport
```

---

## Drift monitoring

EWMA control charts on the correction, without an alarm every generation. &nbsp;·&nbsp; `agentdescent.audit.drift` &nbsp;·&nbsp; [guide](audit.md)

### `DriftKind`

What a signal is telling the operator to do.

| member | value |
|---|---|
| `BIAS_UP` | `'bias-up'` |
| `BIAS_DOWN` | `'bias-down'` |
| `SIGNAL_LOST` | `'signal-lost'` |
| `NOT_INDEPENDENT` | `'not-independent'` |

### `DriftMonitor(...)`

EWMA charts on `delta_hat` and `gain_factor`, generation by generation.

```python
DriftMonitor(
    *,
    lam: float = 0.2,
    L: float = 3.0,
    centre: Optional[float] = None,
    min_gain: float = 1.05,
    gain_lam: float = 0.2
) -> None
```

| method | what it does |
|---|---|
| `observe(rect: Rectification, label: str = '') -> List[DriftSignal]` | Chart one generation. Returns only the signals *this* point raised. |
| `observe_point(point: DriftPoint) -> List[DriftSignal]` | Chart a point assembled by hand. For a caller that is not using `Calibrator`. |

### `DriftPoint(...)`

One generation's rectification, reduced to what a chart needs.

```python
DriftPoint(
    label: str,
    delta_hat: float,
    se: float,
    gain_factor: float,
    n: int,
    covers: Tuple[float, float] = (0.0, 0.0)
) -> None
```

### `DriftReport(...)`

Every point charted, every signal raised, and whether the chart is valid.

```python
DriftReport(
    points: List[DriftPoint] = <factory>,
    z_bias: List[float] = <factory>,
    band: List[float] = <factory>,
    z_gain: List[float] = <factory>,
    signals: List[DriftSignal] = <factory>,
    centre: float = 0.0,
    overlapping: bool = False
) -> None
```

### `DriftSignal(...)`

One alarm, with the number that raised it and what to do.

```python
DriftSignal(
    kind: DriftKind,
    at: int,
    label: str,
    value: float,
    z: float,
    limit: float,
    detail: str
) -> None
```

## Coverage allocation

Where the improvement labels go: Good-Turing unseen mass, not Neyman. &nbsp;·&nbsp; `agentdescent.audit.coverage` &nbsp;·&nbsp; [guide](audit.md)

### `Coverage(key: str, labels: int, modes: int, singletons: int, unseen: float) -> None`

What one key has taught so far, and how much it still has to teach.

### `CoveragePlan(...)`

Per-key inclusion probabilities for the improvement pool.

```python
CoveragePlan(
    rates: Dict[str, float],
    target_n: Dict[str, int],
    weights: Dict[str, float],
    unseen: Dict[str, float],
    default_rate: float = 0.0,
    total_n: int = 0,
    expected_units: int = 0,
    unseen_overall: float = nan,
    warnings: List[str] = <factory>
) -> None
```

### `coverage_of(...)`

Group resolved records by `key` and measure the variety inside each.

```python
coverage_of(
    records: Iterable[Any],
    key: Callable[[Any], str],
    mode: Callable[[Any], Optional[str]],
    *,
    keys: Sequence[str] = ()
) -> Dict[str, Coverage]
```

### `exhausted(coverage: Mapping[str, Coverage], min_unseen: float = 0.05) -> List[str]`

Keys where the next label is unlikely to show anything new.

### `plan_coverage(...)`

Allocate `target_n` improvement labels by how much each key can still teach.

```python
plan_coverage(
    *,
    weights: Mapping[str, float],
    expected_units: int,
    coverage: Mapping[str, Coverage],
    target_n: int = 100,
    min_per_key: int = 5,
    max_rate: float = 1.0
) -> CoveragePlan
```

### `rarefaction(...)`

`[(m, mean distinct modes in a sample of m)]` -- the diminishing return.

```python
rarefaction(
    modes: Sequence[str],
    sizes: Sequence[int],
    *,
    reps: int = 200,
    seed: int = 0
) -> List[Tuple[int, float]]
```

### `rebalance(...)`

How much of the audit budget belongs to calibration, given `unseen`.

```python
rebalance(
    unseen: float,
    *,
    floor: float = 0.5,
    ceiling: float = 0.95,
    learning_at: float = 0.25
) -> float
```

### `unseen_mass(modes: Sequence[Optional[str]]) -> float`

Good-Turing: the probability that the next label shows an unseen mode.

### `unseen_mass_overall(coverage: Mapping[str, Coverage]) -> float`

Good-Turing across every key, pooled by label count.

## The merge path's ranking

Draining the audit scheduler into the queue a person works from. &nbsp;·&nbsp; `agentdescent.audit.queue` &nbsp;·&nbsp; [guide](audit.md)

### `DrainReport(...)`

What came off the queue, and what could not be placed.

```python
DrainReport(
    priorities: Dict[str, float] = <factory>,
    popped: int = 0,
    unplaced: int = 0,
    examples: List[str] = <factory>
) -> None
```

### `drain(...)`

Empty the scheduler's queue into `signature -> priority`.

```python
drain(
    scheduler: Any,
    *,
    signature_of: Optional[Callable[[Any], Optional[str]]] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None
) -> DrainReport
```

### `prioritise(...)`

Order pending records by what the merge path thought was risky.

```python
prioritise(
    records: Iterable[AuditRecord],
    priorities: Dict[str, float],
    *,
    default: float = 0.0
) -> List[AuditRecord]
```

---

## Audit allocation

Neyman allocation, as per-stratum inclusion probabilities. &nbsp;·&nbsp; `agentdescent.audit.sampler` &nbsp;·&nbsp; [guide](audit.md)

### `AuditPolicy(...)`

What the audit is trying to achieve, and what it refuses to do to get there.

```python
AuditPolicy(
    enabled: bool = False,
    target_halfwidth: float = 0.05,
    boundary_width: float = 0.05,
    calibration_fraction: float = 0.7,
    min_per_stratum: int = 20,
    min_dominant: int = 80,
    max_labels: int = 400,
    alpha: float = 0.05
) -> None
```

| parameter | type | default | what it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `bool` | `False` | Off by default. The whole layer is opt-in, and a policy that is not enabled plans a rate of zero everywhere rather than a small one -- "we are not auditing" and "we are auditing a little" produce different records and only one of them is honest. |
| `target_halfwidth` | `float` | `0.05` | How narrow the correction's 95% interval should be. Drives the total label budget through the Neyman-optimal sample size; see `plan`. |
| `boundary_width` | `float` | `0.05` | Half-width of the band around the acceptance threshold that counts as `boundary`. |
| `calibration_fraction` | `float` | `0.7` | Share of audited units that go to the calibration pool rather than the improvement pool. Passed through to the tap. |
| `min_per_stratum` | `int` | `20` | No layer gets fewer than this many labels, whatever Neyman says. A layer allocated two labels contributes a variance estimate from two points, which is worse than not stratifying at all. |
| `min_dominant` | `int` | `80` | The heaviest layer gets at least this many. Defaults to `MIN_N_DOMINANT`, below which the reported coverage is about 0.92 rather than 0.95 -- so this floor and that warning are the same number for the same reason, and moving one without the other is how a floor stops meaning anything. |
| `max_labels` | `int` | `400` | A hard cap. Oracle labels cost money or a person's afternoon, and a target half-width small enough to be unreachable should produce a warning and a bounded plan rather than an unbounded bill. |
| `alpha` | `float` | `0.05` |  |

### `SamplePlan(...)`

Per-stratum inclusion probabilities, and the reasoning that produced them.

```python
SamplePlan(
    rates: Dict[str, float],
    target_n: Dict[str, int],
    weights: Dict[str, float],
    resid_sd: Dict[str, float],
    default_rate: float = 0.0,
    total_n: int = 0,
    expected_units: int = 0,
    warnings: List[str] = <factory>
) -> None
```

### `boundary_stratifier(threshold: float, width: float = 0.05) -> Callable[[Any, str, float], str]`

Split units into `accepted` / `boundary` / `rejected` around a threshold.

### `observed_weights(store: Any, verifier_version: str) -> Dict[str, float]`

Population shares from what a previous run actually saw.

### `plan_audit(...)`

Neyman allocation, converted to per-stratum inclusion probabilities.

```python
plan_audit(
    policy: AuditPolicy,
    *,
    weights: Dict[str, float],
    expected_units: int,
    resid_sd: Optional[Dict[str, float]] = None
) -> SamplePlan
```

| parameter | type | default | what it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| `policy` | `AuditPolicy` | *required* |  |
| `weights` | `Dict[str, float]` | *required* | Population share per stratum. Need not sum to exactly 1; it is normalised, because these usually come from counting a previous run and arriving at 0.9999 should not be an error. |
| `expected_units` | `int` | *required* | How many units the next run is expected to score. Rates are `n_h / (W_h * expected_units)`, so an estimate that is too low oversamples and one that is too high undersamples -- both bounded, and the realised inclusion probability is recorded per unit either way, so a wrong guess costs precision and never correctness. |
| `resid_sd` | `Optional[Dict[str, float]]` | `None` | Per-stratum sd of `f - Y` from the last calibration. Missing entries fall back to an equal-residual assumption, which is what proportional allocation already assumes -- so the first run, with no history, plans proportionally and is right to. |

### `resid_sd_from(previous: Any) -> Dict[str, float]`

`stratum -> resid_sd` out of a `PPIResult`, or `{}`.

---

## The calibrator

Turns a store of audited pairs into a correction the acceptance gate applies. &nbsp;·&nbsp; `agentdescent.audit.calibrator` &nbsp;·&nbsp; [guide](audit.md)

### `Calibrator(...)`

Keeps one rectification per verifier version, and knows when to distrust it.

```python
Calibrator(
    store: AuditStore,
    *,
    alpha: float = 0.05,
    seed: int = 0,
    min_labels: int = 30,
    min_per_stratum: int = 5,
    cluster_by: Optional[str] = 'task_id'
) -> None
```

| parameter | type | default | what it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| `store` | `AuditStore` | *required* | Where the audited pairs and the unlabelled moments live. |
| `alpha` | `float` | `0.05` |  |
| `seed` | `int` | `0` |  |
| `min_labels` | `int` | `30` | Below this many resolved calibration labels the result is stale rather than wide. A very wide interval and "we do not know yet" are different claims, and only the second one stops a caller reading a number off it. |
| `min_per_stratum` | `int` | `5` | A stratum with fewer than this many labels is **merged into the largest one** rather than dropped. Dropping it would silently change the population the estimate describes; merging keeps every unit represented and costs only resolution. |
| `cluster_by` | `Optional[str]` | `'task_id'` | Record attribute the audited units are grouped by, `"task_id"` by default. They are **not** independent draws: a run scores the same task again for every artifact version, and a task the verifier is generous about it is generous about every time. Measured on the Phase 0 audit -- 177 units from 49 tasks -- treating them as independent made the interval **32% too narrow**, and the gate spends that interval's width as `drift`. `None` restores the independent estimate, which is right only when each audited unit is a distinct task. |

| method | what it does |
|---|---|
| `current(verifier_version: str) -> Rectification` | The rectification to apply now, computing it if it is not cached. |
| `mark_stale(reason: str) -> None` | Withhold every rectification until the next `recompute`. |
| `recompute(verifier_version: str) -> Rectification` | Re-read the store and re-estimate. Clears any manual stale mark. |

### `Rectification(...)`

The correction, its uncertainty, and whether it may be used at all.

```python
Rectification(
    verifier_version: str,
    delta_hat: float,
    delta_se: float,
    theta: float,
    theta_ci: Tuple[float, float],
    se: float,
    n: int,
    n_unlab: int,
    gain_factor: float,
    is_stale: bool,
    stale_reason: Optional[str],
    resid_sd: float = nan,
    warnings: List[str] = <factory>,
    computed_at: float = 0.0,
    covers: Tuple[float, float] = (0.0, 0.0)
) -> None
```

| method | what it does |
|---|---|
| `stale(...)` | A rectification that must not be applied, and says why. |

### `population_resid_sd(strata) -> float`

Sd of `f - Y` over the whole population, from the labelled pairs.

---

## Spending the correction

The only place the audit changes an outcome: evidence discounted by verifier noise. &nbsp;·&nbsp; `agentdescent.audit.gate` &nbsp;·&nbsp; [guide](audit.md)

### `Adjustment(...)`

What the audit did to one merge decision, and why.

```python
Adjustment(
    applied: bool,
    reason: str,
    delta_hat: float = 0.0,
    sigma_eps: float = 0.0,
    drift: float = 0.0,
    kappa_base: float = 1.0,
    kappa_cand: float = 1.0,
    var_before: float = 0.0,
    var_after: float = 0.0,
    audit_limited: bool = False,
    stale: bool = False
) -> None
```

| method | what it does |
|---|---|
| `to_detail() -> str` | One clause, for the tail of a refusal a person will read. |

### `RectifiedAcceptance(...)`

An acceptance gate that knows its measurement came from a proxy.

```python
RectifiedAcceptance(
    inner: Any = None,
    *,
    calibrator: Optional[Calibrator] = None,
    verifier_version: Union[str, Callable[[], str]] = '',
    rectification: Optional[Rectification] = None,
    enabled: bool = True,
    drift_allowance: Optional[float] = None,
    inflate_when_stale: float = 2.0,
    explain_refusals: Optional[bool] = None,
    min_kappa: float = 0.001
) -> None
```

| parameter | type | default | what it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| `inner` | `Any` | `None` | The rule that actually decides. Defaults to the shipped gate, with the run's thresholds filled in by the aggregator at install time. |
| `calibrator` | `Optional[Calibrator]` | `None` | Where the correction comes from. Re-read on every decision, so a rectification that goes stale mid-run takes effect at the next merge. |
| `verifier_version` | `Union[str, Callable[[], str]]` | `''` | The version to ask the calibrator about -- a string, or a callable returning one for a verifier that can change under the run. |
| `rectification` | `Optional[Rectification]` | `None` | A fixed correction instead of a calibrator. For a run that measured its bias once, offline, and does not intend to keep measuring. |
| `enabled` | `bool` | `True` | `False` delegates to `inner` on the untouched context. This is the constraint that lets the audit be turned on mid-run: off, it is not approximately the old behaviour, it *is* the old call. |
| `drift_allowance` | `Optional[float]` | `None` | Standard deviation to carry for `Delta` differing between the two sides being compared. `None` uses the rectification's own `se`, which is the right order of magnitude and not an estimate of the thing (see the module docstring). |
| `inflate_when_stale` | `float` | `2.0` | Variance multiplier while no usable correction exists. `1.0` passes through instead, which is the choice to treat "we have not measured the verifier" and "the verifier is unbiased" as the same claim. |
| `explain_refusals` | `Optional[bool]` | `None` |  |
| `min_kappa` | `float` | `0.001` |  |

| method | what it does |
|---|---|
| `current() -> Optional[Rectification]` | The rectification in force, or `None` if there is no source. |
| `explain(ctx) -> Adjustment` | What `accept` would do to `ctx`, without deciding anything. |

### `VerifierWatch(...)`

Marks a calibrator stale when the instrument it calibrated may have moved.

```python
VerifierWatch(
    calibrator: Calibrator,
    *,
    fingerprint: Optional[Callable[[], str]] = None,
    artifact_ids: Iterable[str] = (),
    key_globs: Sequence[str] = (),
    layers: Iterable[int] = (),
    store: Any = None
) -> None
```

| method | what it does |
|---|---|
| `check() -> bool` | Re-read the fingerprint; mark stale and return True if it changed. |
| `on_merge(artifact, diff) -> bool` | Call after a diff commits. True means the calibration was withdrawn. |

### `discount_for(...)`

How many of these observations are worth believing, given `extra_var`.

```python
discount_for(
    counts: Tuple[float, float],
    extra_var: float,
    *,
    min_kappa: float = 0.001
) -> Tuple[float, float, float]
```

### `rectified_counts(counts: Tuple[float, float], delta: float) -> Tuple[Tuple[float, float], float]`

Shift `(successes, failures)` so the rate reads `p - delta`.

---

## Prediction-powered inference

The calibration estimator: a stratified mean that borrows the unlabelled scores. &nbsp;·&nbsp; `agentdescent.audit.ppi` &nbsp;·&nbsp; [guide](audit.md)

### `PPIError`

The input cannot support an estimate at all.

### `PPIResult(...)`

The estimate, its interval, and everything needed to distrust it.

```python
PPIResult(
    theta: float,
    ci: Tuple[float, float],
    se: float,
    df: float,
    lambda_: float,
    gain_factor: float,
    n: int,
    n_unlab: int,
    alpha: float,
    warnings: List[str] = <factory>,
    clustered: bool = False,
    per_stratum: Dict[str, Dict[str, float]] = <factory>
) -> None
```

### `Stratum(...)`

One layer of the sampling design, with its labelled and unlabelled halves.

```python
Stratum(
    name: str,
    weight: float,
    f_lab: np.ndarray,
    y_lab: np.ndarray,
    f_unlab: Optional[np.ndarray] = None,
    n_unlab: int = 0,
    mean_unlab: float = 0.0,
    var_unlab: float = 0.0,
    clusters_lab: Optional[Sequence[Any]] = None
) -> None
```

| method | what it does |
|---|---|
| `from_moments(...)` | Build from a running summary of the unlabelled half rather than its scores. |

### `cluster_var_of_mean(values: np.ndarray, clusters: Sequence[Any]) -> Tuple[float, int]`

Variance of `mean(values)` when the units come in correlated groups.

### `ppi_mean_stratified(...)`

Estimate `E[Y]` over a stratified population, using the unlabelled `f`.

```python
ppi_mean_stratified(
    strata: Sequence[Stratum],
    *,
    alpha: float = 0.05,
    k_folds: int = 5,
    seed: int = 0
) -> PPIResult
```

| parameter | type | default | what it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| `strata` | `Sequence[Stratum]` | *required* | One `Stratum` per layer. `weight` must be the **population** share and the weights must sum to 1. |
| `alpha` | `float` | `0.05` | `1 - alpha` is the nominal coverage. 0.05 gives a 95% interval. |
| `k_folds` | `int` | `5` | Folds for cross-fitting `lam`; see `_lambda_crossfit`. |
| `seed` | `int` | `0` | Fixes the fold split, so the same labels give the same interval twice. |

### `t_ppf(p: float, df: float) -> float`

Quantile of Student's t, via the Cornish-Fisher expansion in `1/df`.

---

## Audit estimation

The design-based baseline: a weighted mean of the residual, with an interval. &nbsp;·&nbsp; `agentdescent.audit.estimate` &nbsp;·&nbsp; [guide](audit.md)

### `bootstrap_ci(...)`

Percentile bootstrap interval for `hajek_mean`.

residual_bias(
    records: Iterable,
    *,
    draws: int = 5000,
    alpha: float = 0.05,
    seed: int = 0
) -> Dict[str, object]
```

standard_error(
    values: Sequence[float],
    probs: Sequence[float],
    *,
    draws: int = 2000,
    seed: int = 1,
    clusters: Optional[Sequence] = None
) -> float
```

---

## The audit out of process

The audit's verbs as JSON, for the MCP surface and anything resolving truth later. &nbsp;·&nbsp; `agentdescent.audit.service` &nbsp;·&nbsp; [guide](audit.md)

### `audit_drift(path: str, versions: Optional[Sequence[str]] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]`

Chart one rectification per verifier version, oldest first.

### `audit_pending(...)`

The records waiting on an oracle -- for a person or an experiment system.

    limit: int = 50,
    older_than: Optional[float] = None,
    version: Optional[str] = None,

    version: Optional[str] = None,
    allow: Optional[Sequence[str]] = None,
    pairs: Optional[Sequence[Sequence[str]]] = None
) -> Dict[str, Any]
```

### `audit_resolve(path: str, record_id: str, oracle_score: float) -> Dict[str, Any]`

Attach ground truth to one pending record.

### `audit_scorecard(...)`

---

## Audit records

What one audited measurement is, and how a verifier is versioned. &nbsp;·&nbsp; `agentdescent.audit.records` &nbsp;·&nbsp; [guide](audit.md)

### `AuditRecord(...)`

One `(task, output)` pair scored by the verifier, awaiting or carrying truth.

```python
AuditRecord(
    record_id: str,
    task_id: str,
    artifact_signature: str,
    output: str,
    verifier_version: str,

## Staleness policies

What to do with a diff proposed against a version that has moved. &nbsp;·&nbsp; `agentdescent.staleness` &nbsp;·&nbsp; [guide](staleness.md)

### `FullStaleness()`

Use stale diffs directly regardless of `eta` (max throughput).

### `GuardedStaleness()`

Version-gated with rebase in the middle band (AgentDescent's default).

### `ReflectiveStaleness()`

Always rebase + re-verify; discard only if the improvement no longer holds.

### `StaleAction`

What the aggregator should do with a (possibly stale) evidence card.

| member | value |
|---|---|
| `ACCEPT` | `'accept'` |
| `REBASE` | `'rebase'` |

## Parallelism methods

How a round's work is split across workers: DP / TP / PP. &nbsp;·&nbsp; `agentdescent.parallel` &nbsp;·&nbsp; [guide](parallelism.md)

### `ClusterParallel(...)`

DP over task **clusters**, leased by UCB instead of sharded round-robin.

```python
ClusterParallel(
    cluster_of: Callable[[str], str],
    c: float = 1.4,
    pass_threshold: Optional[float] = None,
    name: str = 'CP'
) -> None
```

| method | what it does |
|---|---|
| `observe(unit: WorkUnit, task_id: str, score: float) -> None` | Feed one rollout's outcome back into the cluster's UCB estimate. |

### `DataParallel(name: str = 'DP') -> None`

DP -- every worker holds the same artifact; the *tasks* (keys) are sharded across workers and their diffs are merged. Coverage rotates each round.

### `ParallelMode`

| member | value |
|---|---|
| `DP` | `'data_parallel'` |
| `TP` | `'tensor_parallel'` |
| `PP` | `'pipeline_parallel'` |

### `ParallelStrategy`

How a round of work is partitioned across `n_workers`.

### `PipelineChain(stages: List[str]) -> None`

An ordered artifact dependency chain, upstream -> downstream.

| method | what it does |
|---|---|
| `blame(stage_success: Dict[str, bool]) -> Optional[str]` | Back-propagate blame to the *earliest* failing stage. |
| `counterfactual_pairs(stage: str) -> List[Tuple[str, str]]` | The {old x new} version swaps to replay for minimal factor analysis. |

### `PipelineParallel(stages: Sequence[str], name: str = 'PP') -> None`

PP -- artifacts form a dependency chain; each worker drives one stage, and a downstream failure back-propagates blame to the earliest failing stage (via `PipelineChain`).

### `SectionViolation`

Raised when a worker's diff touches a key outside its section.

### `TensorParallel(...)`

TP -- one hot artifact is split into `n_sections` disjoint sections; each worker owns a section, so edits are conflict-free *by construction* and the merge is a union (concatenation + a consistency check).

```python
TensorParallel(
    n_sections: int,
    keys: Optional[Sequence[str]] = None,
    route: Optional[Callable[[str], str]] = None,
    name: str = 'TP'
) -> None
```

| method | what it does |
|---|---|
| `section_map() -> Dict[str, int]` | `artifact key -> section`. Empty when no key space was declared. |

### `TensorParallelMerge(n_sections: int, keys: Optional[Sequence[str]] = None) -> None`

Merge section-scoped diffs into one artifact (concatenation + review).

| parameter | type | default | what it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tasks` |  | *required* | Exactly as in `evolve`, which documents them. (Listed rather than left to the paragraph above: a completeness check that reads prose cannot tell a documented parameter from a mentioned one.) |
| `reward` | `Reward` | *required* | As `tasks`. |
| `agent` | `Optional[Agent]` | `None` | As `tasks`. |
| `run` | `Optional[Run]` | `None` | As `tasks`. |
| `propose` | `Optional[Propose]` | `None` | As `tasks`. |
| `strategy` | `Optional[Strategy]` | `None` | As `tasks`. |
| `initial_state` | `Optional[Dict[str, str]]` | `None` | As `tasks`. |
| `blast_radius` | `float` | `0.2` | As `tasks`. |
| `artifact_id` | `str` | `'artifact'` | As `tasks`. |
| `n_workers` | `int` | `4` | Producer threads (`>= 1`). The train tasks are sharded round-robin across them; a worker with an empty shard is not started. |
| `async_ratio` | `int` | `3` | The lag budget, in two senses: a worker refreshes its snapshot once head drifts more than this far ahead, **and** it stops producing while more than this many cards sit un-merged. The second bound matters at cold start, before any commit has moved head. |
| `resync_on_commit` | `bool` | `True` | Refresh every worker as soon as a sweep commits, whatever the ratio. On by default: a worker that starts a rollout against a version a finished sweep has already replaced is doing work the merger will discard, and no workload wants that. This does **not** remove staleness where a real workload gets it. A worker snapshots, then spends the rollout in `run`, then pushes; a commit landing anywhere in that window makes the card stale no matter what the top of the loop does. What it removes is the other source: *starting* a rollout against a snapshot a finished sweep has already superseded. The two coincide only when rollouts are short relative to sweep cadence -- as they are in this repo's synthetic tests and bench workloads, where a rollout is a dictionary lookup and turning this on does collapse η to 0. Those are the cases that need `False`: anything measuring what the lag budget alone does has to switch this off, or the budget is no longer the only resync trigger and the measurement is of something else. Turn it on when the artifact's *content* is what workers reason from, so an out-of-date copy makes the work void rather than merely stale. Evolving a skill library from empty is the case that motivated it: the lag budget fires at `head_v - base_v > async_ratio`, so with the default 3 the first three commits leave every worker still proposing against no library at all, re-deriving what head already has for the merger to discard. |
| `max_seconds` | `float` | `20.0` | Wall-clock budget for the **production phase only**. Two things still happen after it, so budget for them: a bounded shutdown (`shutdown_grace`, since an in-flight rollout cannot be cancelled) and **one held-out scoring pass** to compute `final_reward`. That pass is memoised per (artifact, task), so it is free when the final head was already scored by a sweep and costs a full held-out sweep of the backend when it was not -- which is exactly the case when the budget was too short for any sweep to finish. |
| `max_iters` | `Optional[int]` | `None` | Stop after this many worker rollouts in total (a budget, not a barrier). |
| `max_calls` | `Optional[int]` | `None` | Stop after this many actor invocations (`run` + `propose`) in total. The second half of an equal-budget comparison: two configurations matched on rollouts still differ in model spend whenever one of them asks for more proposals per rollout, and the cheaper unit is the one a reader assumes was held fixed. Both bounds are checked as each rollout lands, so a run overshoots only by what was already in flight. |
| `max_tokens` | `Optional[int]` | `None` | Stop after this many tokens in total (`prompt + completion`), as the meter measured them. The third budget unit, and the one cost is measured in: `max_calls` and `max_iters` count invocations, and a reasoning model can spend 40k tokens on hidden thinking in a single one, so neither bounds the bill. Checked as each rollout lands (tighter than the synchronous path's round barrier), and a `BudgetGovernor` degrades optional spend -- fusion tournaments at 75% of the budget, self-verify at 90% -- before the wall. `None` (default) means unbounded, and no governor is constructed. |
| `stop_on_diminishing_returns` | `bool` | `False` | Stop when the run's measured return per token falls off its own peak by more than `efficiency_floor`. Off by default; needs `max_tokens`. See `evolve`. |
| `efficiency_floor` | `float` | `0.25` | How far below the peak counts as diminishing, when the stop above is on. A self-calibrating ratio, not an absolute rate. See `evolve`. |
| `call_budget` | `Optional[CallBudget]` | `None` | An adaptive per-call thinking budget (o1-style test-time scaling). See `evolve`; the allocation happens before each worker's `propose` call, gated by the same `score` and `governor.remaining_fraction()` the synchronous path uses. |
| `target_reward` | `Optional[float]` | `None` | Stop as soon as a sweep's held-out reward reaches this. Compared against the real reward, never against an acceptance probability. |
| `patience` | `Optional[int]` | `None` | Stop after this many consecutive merge sweeps that fail to beat the best held-out reward seen so far. The async analogue of the synchronous knob: there are no round barriers here, so a *sweep* (one drain-and-merge by the merger) is the unit. `None` disables it. |
| `max_worker_errors` | `int` | `3` | Consecutive failed rollouts before a worker that has *never* succeeded gives up. Workers that have succeeded at least once never retire; they back off and keep trying until the run's own budget ends it. |
| `eval_concurrency` | `int` | `8` | How many held-out tasks the merger scores at once. `1` restores the old sequential behaviour. |
| `pipelined_gate` | `bool` | `False` | Run a merge's **measurement** phase on its own threads instead of on the merger. Off by default. The merger is one thread and it does three things per merge: drain and filter (cheap), score the base and the candidate (expensive), then accept, audit and commit (cheap). Measured on the stub workload, the middle phase is **94% of the merger's gate time** and the merger is ~90% busy, which leaves 4.5 of 8 workers blocked at the backpressure gate at any moment (`docs/efficiency.md`). This lets the merger go back to draining while the measurement runs, so the workers keep producing. **It changes no commit semantics.** At most one candidate per artifact is measured at a time, so every candidate is still committed against the head it was prepared and measured on -- there is no candidate-level staleness to have a policy about. Cards arriving meanwhile accumulate in the aggregator's buffer, which is what the buffer is for, so batches get larger rather than more numerous. Requires an aggregator with `begin_step` / `measure` / `finish_step` (the shipped one has them). A custom one that predates the seam warns and keeps the inline path. |
| `gate_workers` | `int` | `2` | Threads for the measurement phase when `pipelined_gate` is on. Bounded in practice by one candidate per artifact, so the default of 2 is enough for a single-artifact run with one measurement finishing as the next starts. This is a **third** pool -- `n_workers` rollouts, `gate_workers` measurements, each of which fans out over `eval_concurrency` tasks -- so the ceiling your provider sees is `n_workers + gate_workers * eval_concurrency`. |
| `held_out_frac` | `float` | `0.4` | As `tasks`. |
| `repo_path` | `Optional[str]` | `None` | As `tasks`. |
| `agg_config` |  | `None` | As `tasks`. |
| `staleness_policy` | `Optional[StalenessPolicy]` | `None` | As `tasks`. |
| `aggregator_factory` |  | `None` | As `tasks`. |
| `oracle_budget` | `int` | `200` | As `tasks`. |
| `cheap_eval_tasks` | `Optional[int]` | `None` | As in `evolve`: how many held-out tasks the cheap layer scores when ranking candidates. `None` is 8, or the whole held-out set when that is smaller. |
| `fusion_tournament` | `Optional[bool]` | `None` | As in `evolve`: rank the survivors against their fusion before putting one forward. `None` defers to `agg_config`, which is off. The cost/benefit is identical on this path -- there is one merger thread here too, and it pays the ranking on the critical path of every commit. |
| `checkpointing` | `bool` | `False` | As in `evolve`: save the aggregator's search state each round so a later run on the same `repo_path` resumes the search, not just the artifact. Off by default. The merger is the only thread that records a round here, so the write sits on the same single-writer path it does on the synchronous side. |
| `solved_threshold` | `float` | `0.999` | As in `evolve`: the reward at which a task counts as solved and no proposal is requested. Lower it for a graded scorer. |
| `shuffle` | `bool` | `False` | As in `evolve`: shuffle before the positional train/held-out split. Off by default. |
| `seed` | `int` | `0` | As `shuffle`. |
| `self_verify` | `bool` | `True` | As in `evolve`. `False` skips the extra per-trajectory rollout, which is what ports that judge candidates only on held-out want. |
| `shutdown_grace` | `float` | `2.0` | Total seconds to wait for the worker and merger threads after the budget expires -- shared across all of them, not per thread. An in-flight rollout cannot be cancelled, so a slow backend can still overrun it; a warning says so and work already merged is kept. |
| `stall_patience` | `int` | `50` | Merger sweeps that may pass with cards arriving and nothing committing before every worker is forced to resync, regardless of `async_ratio`. Without it a lag budget larger than the staleness tolerance **livelocks** under the Guarded policy: workers propose against a snapshot too old for the policy to accept, every card is discarded, head never moves, and the lag budget therefore never triggers a refresh either. |
| `duration_estimator` | `Optional['DurationEstimator']` | `None` | Pass a `DurationEstimator` to fit `seconds ~ intercept + slope * len(prompt)` online and count rollouts that overran their own estimate by more than `straggler_factor` (`result.stragglers`). This is the design's **L-traj** mechanism, which until now lived only in the reference runtime and so was unreachable from the API a real workload uses. Detection only: resuming a partial rollout would need it to expose its turns, and `run(rendered, task) -> output` is opaque. |
| `straggler_factor` | `float` | `3.0` | As `duration_estimator`. |
| `task_sampler` | `Optional['TaskSampler']` | `None` | Which task a worker takes next from its shard. |
| `on_round` | `Optional[Callable[[RoundInfo], None]]` | `None` | Called with each `RoundInfo` as a merger sweep completes -- progress for a long run. It runs on the merger thread and must be cheap and thread-safe; an exception is reported, not fatal. |
| `stop_when` | `Optional[Callable[[RoundInfo], bool]]` | `None` | Asked after `on_round` with the same `RoundInfo`; `True` ends the run with `stop_reason="stop_when"` -- the caller's own budget (dollars, a deadline, a kill file), checked between merger sweeps like the built-in bounds. Same thread and the same rules as `on_round`. |
| `verbose` | `bool` | `False` | Print one line per merger sweep. |
| `usage` | `Optional[Usage]` | `None` | Share one `Usage` with your model adapters (`claude(usage=u)`, `openai_compatible(usage=u)`) and the result's token counts become real. Without it the run still reports calls, seconds and failures -- `run` is `(rendered, task) -> str`, so an opaque actor has no way to surface tokens, and inventing a number would be worse than reporting zero. |
| `policies` | `Optional['Policies']` | `None` | Bundle of replaceable pieces (`Policies`). Every field defaults to `None` meaning "current behaviour", so `Policies()` and passing nothing are the same run. The individual keyword arguments -- `task_sampler`, `staleness_policy`, `aggregator_factory` -- are shortcuts onto its fields and keep working; an explicit argument wins over a bundle default rather than being silently ignored. Fields whose implementations have not landed yet raise rather than being accepted and ignored: a caller who passes a custom acceptance rule and sees a finished run would reasonably conclude it ran. New capabilities go here rather than adding another parameter to a function that already has thirty-five. |

## Document backends

A tool-using agent over a document that is too big for a prompt. &nbsp;·&nbsp; `agentdescent.backends` &nbsp;·&nbsp; [guide](backends.md)

### `AgentBackend`

A base agent that answers a question about a document, possibly using tools.

### `document_agent(...)`

Turn **any** `Completion` into an `AgentBackend` for document questions.

```python
document_agent(
    completion: Completion,
    *,
    doc_filename: str = 'document.txt',

    skills_dir: str = '.claude/skills'
) -> AgentBackend
```

### `openhands(...)`

A **real OpenHands agent** (SDK v1.x) as a workspace-bindable Completion.

openhands(
    model: str = 'openai/deepseek-v4-pro',
    *,
    base_url: str = 'https://api.deepseek.com',
    api_key_env: str = 'OPENAI_API_KEY',
    temperature: float = 0.0,
    max_iterations: int = 40
) -> '_OpenHandsAgent'
```

### `openhands_backend(...)`

## Ready-made scorers

The reward functions everyone writes, with the details right. &nbsp;·&nbsp; `agentdescent.rewards` &nbsp;·&nbsp; [guide](rewards.md)

### `GraderError`

A `command_scorer` command failed or printed something that is not a score.

### `command_scorer(...)`

Grade with **any program**: the task as JSON on stdin, a float on stdout.

```python
command_scorer(
    cmd: Union[str, Sequence[str]],
    *,
    timeout: float = 60.0,
    cwd: Optional[str] = None
) -> Callable
```

### `contains(gold_key: str = 'gold', *, normalise: bool = True) -> Callable`

1.0 when the gold answer appears anywhere in the output.

### `exact_match(gold_key: str = 'gold', *, normalise: bool = True) -> Callable`

1.0 when the output equals the gold answer.

### `last_number(gold_key: str = 'gold', *, tolerance: float = 0.0) -> Callable`

1.0 when the **last** number in the output matches the gold number.

### `numeric_close(gold_key: str = 'gold', *, tolerance: float = 0.01) -> Callable`

`last_number` with a relative tolerance -- for rounded answers.

### `scorer(score) -> Callable`

Resolve `score` -- a name from `SCORERS` or a `(task, output) -> float` callable -- into the reward `evolve()` takes.

---

## Equal-budget baselines

merge-of-N against best-of-N fork and serial, on one rollout budget. &nbsp;·&nbsp; `agentdescent.baselines` &nbsp;·&nbsp; [guide](results.md)

### `ArmResult(...)`

One arm, one seed, and the spend it actually incurred.

```python
ArmResult(
    arm: str,
    seed: int,
    width: int,
    rollouts: int,
    calls: int,
    prompt_tokens: int,
    completion_tokens: int,
    wallclock: float,
    wallclock_parallel: float,
    dev_reward: float,
    test_reward: Optional[float],
    test_oracle: Optional[float] = None,
    forks: Tuple[ForkOutcome, ...] = (),
    stop_reason: str = '',
    error: Optional[str] = None,
    fusion: Optional['FusionStats'] = None
) -> None
```

### `Budget(rollouts: int, calls: Optional[int] = None, tokens: Optional[int] = None) -> None`

What every arm is allowed to spend.

| method | what it does |
|---|---|
| `split(ways: int) -> 'Budget'` | The share of this budget one of `ways` independent runs may spend. |

### `Comparison(...)`

Several seeds of several arms, and whether they are comparable at all.

```python
Comparison(
    arms: Dict[str, List[ArmResult]],
    fixed: str = 'rollouts',
    unequal: List[Tuple[str, str, float, float]] = <factory>,
    confounded: List[Tuple[str, str, float, float]] = <factory>,
    tolerance: float = 0.1
) -> None
```

| method | what it does |
|---|---|
| `scored(arm: str) -> int` | Seeds of `arm` that produced a test score at all. |
| `separates(a: str, b: str, *, min_seeds: int = 3) -> bool` | Whether `a`'s seeds are all above `b`'s, with no overlap. |
| `spread(arm: str) -> Optional[Tuple[float, float, float]]` | (min, median, max) test quality. Not a confidence interval. |
| `underpowered(*arms: str, min_seeds: int = 3) -> bool` | Whether any named arm has too few seeds to support a comparison. |

### `ForkOutcome(...)`

One member of a fork arm, kept so the selection step can be audited.

```python
ForkOutcome(
    seed: int,
    dev_reward: float,
    test_reward: Optional[float],
    rollouts: int,
    calls: int
) -> None
```

### `Workload(...)`

The half of the comparison that must not vary, in one object.

```python
Workload(
    tasks: Sequence[Task],
    reward: Reward,
    test_eval: Callable[[EvolutionResult], float],
    agent: Optional[Any] = None,
    run: Optional[Any] = None,
    propose: Optional[Any] = None,
    strategy: Optional[Any] = None,
    evolve_kwargs: Mapping[str, Any] = <factory>
) -> None
```

### `best_of_n_fork(...)`

N runs that never see each other, each on its share of the budget.

```python
best_of_n_fork(
    workload: Workload,
    n: int,
    *,
    budget: Budget,
    seed: int = 0,
    concurrency: int = 1
) -> ArmResult
```

### `compare(...)`

Group arm results by arm and check what the comparison actually held fixed.

```python
compare(
    results: Sequence[ArmResult],
    *,
    fixed: str = 'rollouts',
    tolerance: float = 0.1
) -> Comparison
```

### `merge_of_n(...)`

N workers proposing into one artifact, merged every round. The claim.

```python
merge_of_n(
    workload: Workload,
    n: int,
    *,
    budget: Budget,
    seed: int = 0,
    usage: Optional[Usage] = None
) -> ArmResult
```

### `serial(...)`

One worker, improving itself in sequence. The floor.

```python
serial(
    workload: Workload,
    *,
    budget: Budget,
    seed: int = 0,
    usage: Optional[Usage] = None
) -> ArmResult
```

### `to_markdown(comparison: Comparison) -> str`

A table whose caption cannot claim more than the numbers support.

---

## Type aliases and constants

Values rather than classes or functions.

### `AcceptDecision`

Commit or not, and -- when not -- which of the merge categories it was.

### `AcceptancePolicy`

Whether a candidate is committed.

### `AggregatorFactory`

`(ledger, verifier, audit, config, policy) -> AggregatorProtocol` — how a custom optimizer is installed.

### `AppendRules`

Accumulate a deduped list of rules/lessons (append-only, content-addressed).

### `BudgetGovernor`

Tracks token spend against a cap and decides what to degrade.

### `CALIBRATION_CEILING`

Where a calibration share sits when the improvement pool is still finding new error modes, and where it goes once the pool has stopped. Both are policy choices, not measurements: what a label is worth in each pool depends on whether you are trying to *fix* the verifier or to *correct for* it.

### `CALIBRATION_FLOOR`

Where a calibration share sits when the improvement pool is still finding new error modes, and where it goes once the pool has stopped. Both are policy choices, not measurements: what a label is worth in each pool depends on whether you are trying to *fix* the verifier or to *correct for* it.

### `CacheProtocol`

Somewhere to keep evaluations. In one process, across many, or on disk.

### `CallBudget`

A mutable per-call max_tokens, set by the engine before each expansion.

### `Completion`

`Callable[[str], str]` — the one contract every model and agent satisfies.

### `ConflictPolicy`

Which of a batch of mutually contradictory changes survive.

### `DefaultConflict`

Drop contradicting diffs, keeping whichever scores better (PCGrad-style).

### `DefaultFusion`

Build the union of complementary diffs and hand it to the gate.

### `EDIT_PROTOCOL`

The multi-file proposal format a `FileTree` reflector is told to emit.

### `Executor`

Runs rollouts somewhere. Threads here, processes and hosts later.

### `FAST_MAX`

The L2/L1 blast-radius boundary (`0.30`).

### `FLIP_ALARM`

Flip rate above which a rescan is called out rather than reported. The plan's number. It is a policy choice and not a measurement -- there is no rate at which silently re-scoring a run's history becomes fine.

### `FROZEN_IDS`

Artifact ids the loop may read but never mutate (L0).

### `FileCache`

A directory of evaluations, so separate processes can share them.

### `FusionPolicy`

How complementary diffs become one candidate.

### `FusionTrial`

One tournament: what the fused candidate scored against the best single.

### `KeyedRules`

One entry per *category*: competing proposals contradict and are resolved.

### `LAYOUTS`

Where a runner writes the evolving tree inside a workspace (`claude_skill`, `skill_library`, `claude_agent`, `dsh_skill`, `agents_skill`, `root`).

### `LedgerFailure`

The exception tuple a caller catches to treat any ledger problem as recoverable.

### `LedgerProtocol`

Seven methods: four the aggregator calls, three more the engine calls.

### `LocalWorkspaceSandbox`

A throwaway directory on this machine -- what a rollout has always got.

### `MAX_COMBINATIONS`

Combinations the search will build before it complains. Not a performance limit -- each one is a pass over the labelled set, which is a few hundred rows -- but a statistical one: every combination scored is another chance for one to look good by luck, and a search over a thousand of them on two hundred labels is fitting the noise.

### `MIN_N_DOMINANT`

Labels the heaviest stratum needs before the reported interval means what it says. Below it, measured coverage is about 0.92 against a nominal 0.95 -- see pitfall 3 in the module docstring, and `test_known_limitation_small_dominant_stratum`.

### `MIN_UNSEEN`

Below this estimated probability of a new mode, more improvement labels are buying the flat part of the rarefaction curve. Not a law -- the point at which a one-in-twenty chance of learning something stops being worth an oracle call is a budget question -- but it is where the Phase 0 curve had flattened.

### `MemoryCache`

In-process, single-flight, counted.

### `MergeContext`

Everything an `AcceptancePolicy` is allowed to look at.

### `PLUGIN_FROZEN`

Frozen by default for each host, on top of whatever the spec freezes. Hooks and permission config are the plugin's own L0: a hook that blocks a tool call is a guard, and an optimizer that could loosen it to score better would be optimising the guard away. Lockfiles are regenerated by tooling in `setup`, not authored by a model. Tests are frozen for the same reason as in `code_runner`: the shortest path to a high score is to weaken the yardstick.

### `PLUGIN_HOSTS`

The hosts a `plugin`-kind spec may name. Paths are relative to the workspace.

### `PRIORITY_SEED`

Upstream ERA's flat PUCT -- `rank + c * P(s,a) * sqrt(N) / (1 + n)` with `c = 1` and a uniform prior. `PrioritySelection` on this source expands the same node as `FlatPuct(c_puct=1.0)` at every step.

### `Policies`

Every replaceable piece, in one argument.

### `ProcessExecutor`

Persistent worker processes, with re-dispatch when one dies.

### `Promotion`

One artifact the `PromotionPolicy` believes `stable` should hold.

### `PromotionPolicy`

Which artifacts `dev` has proved well enough to copy onto `stable`.

### `ProposalContext`

What a `ProposalPolicy` is given for one rollout.

### `ProposalPolicy`

How a rollout becomes candidate changes.

### `Ref`

A callable named rather than sent: `"module:attribute"` plus config.

### `RefError`

A reference could not be resolved, and why -- never a bare ImportError.

### `Result`

What one rollout produced, or why it did not.

### `RolloutSpec`

One rollout, described completely enough to run somewhere else.

### `SCHEMA_VERSION`

Bumped when the on-disk shape of a record changes incompatibly. A reader that meets a record it does not understand must say so rather than guess -- see `load`.

### `SCORERS`

Named scorers accepted by `scorer`. Pass a callable for anything else.

### `SLOTS`

The decision plane -- the `Policies` fields a run may evolve. The machinery fields (`verifier`, `ledger`, `executor`, `evaluator`, `eval_cache`, `aggregator_factory`, `sandbox_*`) are the training code and stay frozen.

### `SLOT_PROTOCOLS`

The contract each slot's value must satisfy -- the engine's own Protocols, all `runtime_checkable`, so a compiled class is checked structurally.

### `SOLVED`

Reward at or above which a task counts as solved (`0.999`). Lower it for a graded scorer, or every rollout asks the reflector to fix an answer that was already good.

### `STALE_INFLATION`

Variance multiplier the acceptance gate applies while a rectification is stale. Not a correction -- a stale rectifier has no number to correct *with* -- but a widening, so a gate that cannot be told how biased its verifier is commits less rather than the same amount with more confidence.

### `Sandbox`

One acquired execution environment.

### `SandboxPool`

The single gate on how many sandboxes exist at once.

### `SandboxProvider`

Where sandboxes come from and go back to.

### `SandboxSpec`

What environment one rollout needs. Must survive JSON: it crosses processes.

### `SharedSandboxPool`

A pool whose ceiling is the machine's, not this process's.

### `SingleSlot`

The artifact **is one value**, and each accepted proposal replaces it.

### `Strategy`

Defines *what evolves and how* -- the representation and the merge rule.

### `TEST_FAILURE_MARKER`

Prefix of the output `code_runner` produces when the frozen gate fails, so the failure scores 0 and the reflector can read it.

### `ThreadExecutor`

The default: a bounded pool of threads in this process.

### `VerifierProtocol`

Four methods, from `grep 'self\.verifier\.' agentdescent/aggregator.py`.

### `VersionVector`

`Dict[str, int]` — artifact id to version.

### `WorkspaceProvider`

Provisions `LocalWorkspaceSandbox` -- `mkdtemp`, plus a lease file.

### `backends`

Agentic backends -- a base agent that *navigates documents with tools*, not just maps a prompt to text.

### `baselines`

The control every efficiency number in this repository is missing.

### `budgeted_completion`

Wrap a `max_tokens -> Completion` factory into an adaptive Completion.

### `dataloader`

Dependency-free dataset loading -- the *data layer* for examples/experiments.

### `rule_id`

Content-address a proposal so identical proposals dedupe automatically.
